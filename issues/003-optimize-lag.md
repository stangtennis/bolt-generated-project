## Description
Optimize the remote desktop application to minimize lag and improve responsiveness. Current performance can be improved in several areas.

## Areas for Optimization
1. Screen Capture
   - Implement frame skipping when lag is detected
   - Optimize image compression settings
   - Add dynamic quality adjustment based on network conditions
   - Consider implementing frame diffing to only send changed areas

2. Network Communication
   - Implement WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connection
   - Add data compression for all communications
   - Optimize Socket.IO event handling
   - Implement better event throttling

3. Input Handling
   - Optimize mouse event batching
   - Improve keyboard event processing
   - Reduce input latency

4. Resource Usage
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Reduce CPU load
   - Better cleanup of resources

## Success Metrics
- Reduce average latency to under 50ms
- Maintain consistent frame rate of 30+ FPS
- Reduce CPU usage by 30%
- Reduce network bandwidth usage by 40%
